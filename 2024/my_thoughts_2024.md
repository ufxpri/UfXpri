## Overall 2024 Insights

### 1. AI Collaboration: Possibility vs Production
- **Discovery**: AI can quickly create new modules (K-water, shortform projects)
- **Reality check**: Production-level features (retry, logging, tracking) are a separate domain
- **Strategic insight**: For complex features, using verified solutions (Airflow, Celery) is more efficient than having AI write code from scratch

### 2. Architecture Competency: Dependency Management
- **Key success**: Sidecar pattern effectively solved AI-generated code's "black box problem"
- **Core principle**: Thorough modularization and dependency separation are essential

### 3. Growth Direction: From Speed to Depth
- **Validated**: Overwhelming development speed through K-water project
- **Next level**: Use saved time to develop "architecture design" and "operational strategy (planning)" competencies
- **Shift**: From "how fast did I do it" to "how far ahead did I think"

### 4. Documentation Culture
- **Realization**: Documentation is not overhead but investment
- **Practice**: Systematic documentation of backend work history and technical issues builds team's technical assets
- **Future**: Share clear data and metrics with management, manage project risks and milestones effectively

### 5. Communication Evolution
- **Growth needed**: Move beyond "simple sharing" to data-driven communication
- **Goal**: Share project risks and milestones with management based on clear data and indicators
- **Challenge**: Improve communication with managers regarding data-based decision support and priority sharing

### 6. Quality vs Speed Balance
- **Q1 lesson**: Excessive documentation time (up to 1 month) can be inefficient for projects needing quick validation
- **Strategy**: Flexibly adjust documentation level according to project nature (MVP vs formal)
- **Principle**: "Sprint goal achievement" should take priority over "perfect system"

### 7. Capacity Planning Importance
- **Hard lesson**: GPU resource estimation failure led to 2-week deployment delay
- **Root cause**: Overlooked differences between local environment and production
- **Future requirement**: Mandatory capacity planning (hardware requirement estimation) before project initiation

### 8. Process Over Heroics
- **Insight**: Individual heroics (working overtime, fixing issues solo) don't scale
- **Solution**: Build systems where anyone can handle newly arising tasks
- **Investment**: Create processes and documentation for team sustainability
